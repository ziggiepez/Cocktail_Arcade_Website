          For my project I made my cabinet out of tables, and dressers, I found on the side of the road, that people had put out for garbage. The front and back of the cabinet are made from the fronts of dresser drawers that are connected with a strip of scrap wood down each side on the inside. The outside was made flat (kind of) with a lot of wood filler and sanding. You can see where some wood filler has fallen out on the front of the cabinet from moving it around. You can also see, on the front controller, that I broke the wood by accident while putting it together. I did the best I could with what I had to reattach both sides that were broken and make it look whole again. Ill probably replace the front controller box.

          As you can see, I added a hinge to the top of my cocktail arcade cabinet. This allows for access to my monitor, mini pc, speakers, and all the wires inside of my cabinet. I use the side controllers for my <a href="https://www.arcadepunks.com/coinops-retro-arcade-2-pc-cab-build-vertical-edition/" target="_blank"><b class="red">vertical</b></a> Coinops arcade set up, and the hinged front for regular arcade games and other emulators. And of course, I use all the controllers together when I have people over and we play 4 player beat em ups like X Men or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

          Finaly, we have the inside of my arcade cabinet. I made a shelf on the inside to hold my keyboard and mouse for the pc, but I also had a Playstation classic lying around so I attached that to the shelf and monitor. All my emulation, and rom, setups are saved to an external hard drive, so I can load them up on any of my computers. I only had to buy the pc, monitor, and joysticks/buttons. The mini pc cost $210 on sale. The monitor cost $20 from someone on craigslist. The joysticks and buttons, with the wiring and control boards, cost $80. altogether, I only spent $310 on new parts for this cocktail arcade. I already had extra nails screws, speakers, keyboard, mouse and any other miscellanies components used.
