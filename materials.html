        The wood you use for your cabinet is the most important component. I would recommend using 1/2-inch thick MDF for the front, sides, back, and controller boxes of your cocktail table, and 3/4 or 1-inch thick MDF for the top of your cocktail table. Having a consistent thickness throughout your project will make the prosses much easier, but if, like me, you want to spend as little as possible you can use almost any wood you have laying around. I made mine out of dressers and tables I found on the sides of the road. I would not recommend this though if you have more money to put into the project as the differing thicknesses caused extra issues. <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pl/Mdf-medium-density-fiberboard--Plywood-sheathing-Lumber-composites-Building-supplies/3221732066751?refinement=1920253794927" target="_blank"><b class="red">Click here for wood</b></a>

        You can do your entire project with just a jigsaw, a hammer, and nails, but if you have a circular saw the straight cuts will be much easier and come out cleaner. If you prefer screws over nails a drill will be a must, and don’t forget to predrill your holes. A palm sander will also be nice to have, especially if you want to inset and fill your screw holes. You don’t need hole saw drill bits, as you can use the jigsaw to cut holes, but they will make the holes for the joystick and buttons easier. A great place to get tools for cheap is <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/" target="_blank"><b class="red">Harbor Freight</b></a> if there are any that you need for the project.

        For the monitor it will be important to keep in mind what the capabilities of your computer are. For mini pcs or a Raspberry Pie, I would recommend using a 720p monitor if you can find one. If your computer has a dedicated graphics card, you should be safe to go up to a 1080p monitor for emulating arcade games. Many cheap options can be found on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist. I ended up getting a 22in 720p tv for $20 from someone on Craigslist for my cocktail arcade. If you have an old obsolete laptop laying around, you can also repurpose the screen with a control board.

          Most emulation platforms, such as Retropie and Coinops, come pre-configured to work with an Xbox One controller or generic controller set to x-input mode. I prefer to use 8 Bit Do controllers set to x-input mode for PSX, SNES, Genesis, etcetera, but for arcade games you're going to want to have an arcade stick and some buttons. You can purchase the components bundled together or one at a time from Amazon, and then install them into your controller boxes that you have made for your cocktail arcade base. Then you must configure them inside of your emulation platform. <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/?spm=a2g0o.home.logo.1.2ad22145dCy6gh&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa" target="_blank"><b class="red">Aliexpress</b></a> has the cheapest arcade sticks if you can wait a while.
